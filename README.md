# mini-selector
jQuery-like minimal selector for DGPad

## DOMStorage

A simple hash map that pulls data in and out of **HTMLElements** with `data` attributes. In this project it is used for storing event data.

## MiniSelector

The **MiniSelector** is a very simple wrapper for **DOM Elements** that resembles **jQuery** a lot. It is designed internally as a series of modules that expand the `selector` function.

This `class`'s only intention is to help in the transcoding of **DGPad** into **TypeScript**.
